**🛒 Grocery Price Comparator Chatbot (Web Scraping + Chatbot Integration)**

A smart solution to compare grocery product prices across multiple platforms like BigBasket and Zepto using Web Scraping and an integrated Chatbot interface.

**📖 Project Description**

This project involves scraping product data such as name, price, availability, and unit quantity from popular online grocery platforms including BigBasket and Zepto.

The scraped data is then integrated with an interactive chatbot that enables users to:

Search for a specific grocery item

View real-time prices across multiple platforms

Check product availability

Get the best deal suggestions

The scrapped datas are stored in Mongodb

Receive responses in a conversational format

**💡 Features**

🔍 Product search using a natural language chatbot

🛒 Price and stock comparison from BigBasket and Zepto

📊 Displays product details like name, price, availability, and unit size

🤖 Chatbot interface for smooth and simple user queries

📦 Helps users choose the cheapest or most available option instantly

🔄 Real-time or regularly updated scraping

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Python

Selenium (for web scraping)

Flask(for chatbot)

Backend(Mongodb)

**🗃️ Data Sources**

BigBasket

Zepto

(Scraping follows ethical practices and respects robots.txt of each site. For demo purposes only.)

**🚀 How It Works**

The user interacts with the chatbot via console or web interface

A query like: "Compare price of Aashirvaad Atta" is entered

The bot triggers the scraping logic or reads from a scraped data cache

Results from both platforms are fetched and shown:

Product name

Price (₹)

Availability

Quantity / Pack size

Bot gives a final suggestion: "Cheapest price for Aashirvaad Atta is on Zepto at ₹210"

**✅ Advantages**

Saves time and effort for users looking for the best grocery deals

Offers a chatbot interface for quick and user-friendly interaction

Helps make smarter and cost-effective purchase decisions

Can be extended to more platforms (e.g., Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart)
